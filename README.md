# Learning Resources for Machine Learning and ML tools

## How to get help:
Read this document. No really.
If you're unsure about something, or have any questions, or even if you just want to say hi please join our [Bath ML Slack channel](http://bathml.herokuapp.com/).
Should you not wish to speak publicly feel free to PM @kinbiko.

## Slack
Our Slack server can be found [here](https://bathml.slack.com). 
Slack is a instant messaging tool for teams - which also persists messages, meaning you don't have to be logged in constantly to be a part of our chat.
Our Slack channels is gradually growing, and we're seeing many great contributions and suggestions. It really is THE place to get to know the community.

## Git & GitHub
Presumably, you are now reading this file on <https://github.com/Bath-ML/learning-resources>.
GitHub is a webservice dedicated to hosting Git repositories - usually source code and resources used by development teams.
If you are completely new to Git have a look at [this link for a quick basic tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE) on how to get started. Once you're comfortable, have a look at the [Bath-ML Organisation's public repositories](https://github.com/Bath-ML) and see if there's anything there that you want to contribute to. If you have any suggestions to projects contact us on Slack!

## Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a platform for data science competitions. Kaggle is a great site for finding problems to solve, datasets and viewing other people's code and solutions to problems for the sake of learning.

## Community driven blogs
The following blogs are written by members of our community. If you'd like to have your blog posted here either raise a pull request or check out the #community-blogs channel on Slack.
